![Customers call after 5 PM](https://www.simplifai-solutions.com/images/blogs/ai-receptionists-worth-it-2026-real-cost-breakdown/customers-call-after-5.jpeg)

**Quick Answer:**  
For most small service businesses in the United States, an AI receptionist costs significantly less than a full-time human receptionist while covering far more hours, especially during evenings and weekends when customers are actually calling. The real question is not whether AI is cheaper. The real question is how much revenue you are losing when calls go unanswered after hours.

## 📊 The Real Cost of Hiring a Receptionist in the U.S.

![Human vs AI receptionist cost comparison](https://www.simplifai-solutions.com/images/blogs/ai-receptionists-worth-it-2026-real-cost-breakdown/human_vs_AI_cost.jpeg)

If you are considering hiring someone to answer your phones, you need to look at more than hourly pay.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes wage data for receptionists and information clerks, including median hourly wages and annual earnings. You can review the official numbers here:

[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics – Receptionists Wage Data](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes434171.htm)

According to BLS data, the median hourly wage for receptionists is in the high teens per hour. At 40 hours per week, that quickly turns into a base annual salary in the mid to high $30,000 range.

But that is not your true cost.

You must also account for:

- Employer payroll taxes  
- Federal and state unemployment insurance  
- Workers compensation  
- Paid time off  
- Training time  
- Equipment and workspace  

The Small Business Administration explains employer tax responsibilities here:

[SBA – Employer Payroll and Tax Responsibilities](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/manage-your-business/pay-taxes)

When you combine wages and employment overhead, many small businesses realistically spend between $45,000 and $55,000 per year for a reliable full-time receptionist.

And that still only covers business hours.

## 🌙 The Part Most Owners Overlook: Customers Call After Hours

![Closed business but customers are calling](https://www.simplifai-solutions.com/images/blogs/ai-receptionists-worth-it-2026-real-cost-breakdown/closed_but_people_call.jpeg)

Here is where the conversation changes.

Most business owners assume the majority of calls happen between 9 AM and 5 PM. That used to be true. It is not anymore.

A recent small business communication study found that approximately 67 percent of customer calls occur outside traditional business hours.

You can see reporting on that data here:

[Small Business Communication Study – After Hours Call Data](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/callvera-ai_recent-research-reveals-a-significant-gap-activity-7402002530026729472-wU4R)

Additional industry reporting shows that more than half of inbound calls now happen after 5 PM, especially in service industries where customers research during the day and call at night.

[Unicom Corp – Overnight Answering Service Insights](https://www.unicomcorp.com/blog/overnight-answering-service/)

Think about that for a moment.

If most calls happen when you are closed, and you only staff phones during business hours, you are not comparing a $50,000 employee to a $5,000 AI system.

You are comparing coverage to no coverage.

And that is a revenue problem.

## 🤖 What an AI Receptionist Actually Costs

AI receptionist platforms typically charge a monthly subscription based on call volume.

Public pricing references from providers like Smith.ai show typical plans ranging from a few hundred dollars per month depending on usage.

[Smith.ai Pricing](https://smith.ai/pricing)

Industry pricing guides show that most small service businesses land between $200 and $500 per month for 24/7 AI call handling.

[AI Receptionist Pricing Guide](https://www.getnextphone.com/blog/ai-receptionist-pricing-guide)

That means your annual cost is often between $2,400 and $6,000.

And unlike a human receptionist, that coverage includes:

- Nights  
- Weekends  
- Holidays  
- Overflow during peak hours

## 📈 Why Speed to Response Matters Financially

![Immediate call pickup vs voicemail delay](https://www.simplifai-solutions.com/images/blogs/ai-receptionists-worth-it-2026-real-cost-breakdown/call_picked_up_right_away.jpeg)

Harvard Business Review published research showing that responding to leads quickly dramatically increases connection and conversion rates.

You can review the research here:

[Harvard Business Review – The Short Life of Online Sales Leads](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads)

If a motivated customer calls at 7:30 PM after researching options online and your phone goes to voicemail, the probability that they call back the next day is not high.

They often call the next business.

This is especially true in industries like:

- HVAC  
- Lawn care  
- Car detailing  
- Real estate  

For example, you can explore how speed impacts real estate response here:

[Why Speed to Response Matters in Real Estate](https://simplifai-solutions.com/blogs/why-speed-to-response-matters-in-real-estate-ai-receptionist)

Speed is not convenience.

Speed is conversion.

## 🛠 When AI Makes the Most Sense

AI receptionists are a strong fit when:

- You miss after-hours calls  
- You are on job sites during the day  
- Most calls follow predictable patterns  
- Your revenue depends on being first to answer  

If you want industry-specific examples, start here:

## 🤝 When a Human or Hybrid Model Is Better

AI is not perfect for every scenario.

If your calls regularly involve:

- Long emotional conversations  
- Complex negotiations  
- High-trust advisory interactions  

Then a hybrid model may be more appropriate.

You can compare all three models here:

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Do customers really call after business hours?

Yes. Multiple industry reports show that a majority of calls now occur outside traditional 9 AM to 5 PM windows, particularly in service industries. If you are not answering at night or on weekends, you are likely missing motivated buyers.

[After-Hours Call Trends](https://www.unicomcorp.com/blog/overnight-answering-service/)

---

### Is an AI receptionist cheaper than hiring a receptionist?

In most cases, yes. Once you include wages, payroll taxes, benefits, and turnover, a human receptionist often costs ten times more annually than an AI system with full 24/7 coverage.

[BLS Receptionist Wage Data](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes434171.htm)

---

### Can an AI receptionist book appointments?

Yes. Modern systems can capture contact details, answer common questions, qualify leads, and schedule appointments automatically.

For workflow details, see:

[Automating Lead Qualification for Service Businesses](https://simplifai-solutions.com/blogs/automating-lead-qualification-for-service-businesses)

---

### What happens if AI cannot answer a question?

Well-designed systems escalate to a human or collect detailed information for follow-up instead of guessing.

You can review capability limits here:

---

### Is this just voicemail?

No. Voicemail requires the customer to leave a message and wait. AI receptionists aim to complete the conversation in real time.

## 🏁 Final Takeaway

The decision is not about replacing humans.

It is about covering the hours when customers actually call.

If 50 to 67 percent of calls happen outside traditional business hours, and your business only answers during the day, then your comparison is not between AI and a receptionist.

It is between answered calls and missed revenue.

[How to Stop Missing Calls](https://simplifai-solutions.com/blogs/how-to-stop-missing-calls)

Or run your own math based on your real call volume and job value. When you do that honestly, the answer usually becomes clear.
