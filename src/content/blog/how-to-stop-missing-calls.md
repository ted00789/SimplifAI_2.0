## Quick Answer

If you’re missing calls, you’re losing customers. Most callers won’t leave a voicemail and will immediately call the next business. The fix is simple: ensure every call is answered, logged, and followed up automatically.

## Why Missed Calls Are So Expensive

When someone calls your business, they usually have intent **right now**.  
They are not browsing. They are trying to solve a problem.

If no one answers:
- They assume you’re unavailable
- They move on
- You never hear about it again

## The Real Fix

The fastest-growing service businesses do three things:

1. Answer every call instantly
2. Capture caller details automatically
3. Follow up within minutes, not hours

## Final Thought

You don’t need more leads.  
You need to stop losing the ones you already have.
